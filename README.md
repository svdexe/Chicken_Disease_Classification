## üß† Model Training and Evaluation

### Data Version Control (DVC)

We use DVC to manage our ML pipelines. Here are the main commands:

```bash
dvc init
dvc repro
dvc dag
```

### Workflow Steps

1. Update `config.yaml`
2. Update `params.yaml`
3. Update the entity
4. Update the configuration manager in `src/config`
5. Update the components
6. Update the pipeline
7. Update `main.py`
8. Update `dvc.yaml`

## üö¢ Deployment

### AWS CI/CD Deployment with GitHub Actions

#### 1. Login to AWS console

#### 2. Create IAM user for deployment
- Set up user with programmatic access
- Assign following permissions:
  - EC2 access: Allows management of virtual machines
  - ECR: Elastic Container Registry to store docker images
  
**Required Policies:**
  - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
  - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`

**Deployment Process Overview:**
1. Build docker image of the source code
2. Push docker image to ECR
3. Launch EC2 instance 
4. Pull image from ECR to EC2
5. Launch docker image in EC2

#### 3. Create ECR repository
- This will store/save your docker image
- Note the URI, e.g., `566373416292.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/chicken`

#### 4. Create EC2 machine
- Choose Ubuntu as the operating system

#### 5. Install docker on EC2
```bash
# Update and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

#### 6. Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner

### Azure CI/CD Deployment with GitHub Actions

Azure provides a straightforward way to set up CI/CD deployment using GitHub Actions. Follow these steps to deploy your application:

#### 1. Azure Container Registry (ACR) Setup
- Create an Azure Container Registry
- Note down the login server name

#### 2. Prepare and Push Docker Image
Run these commands from your local terminal:
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t chickenapp.azurecr.io/chicken:latest .

# Login to your Azure Container Registry
docker login chickenapp.azurecr.io

# Push the image to ACR
docker push chickenapp.azurecr.io/chicken:latest
```

#### 3. Azure Web App Deployment
1. Create a Web App in Azure
2. Configure it to use the Docker Container from ACR

#### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions with Azure

Azure can automatically set up GitHub Actions for your CI/CD pipeline:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Web App
2. Go to the "Deployment Center" section
3. Choose GitHub as your source control
4. Authenticate and select your repository
5. Azure will automatically generate and commit a GitHub Actions workflow file to your repository

#### 5. Deployment Process Overview
1. Build the Docker image of the Source Code
2. Push the Docker image to Container Registry
3. Launch the Web App Server in Azure
4. Pull the Docker image from the container registry to Web App server and run

With these steps completed, your Azure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your application when you push changes to your repository.

Note: Ensure that you keep any automatically generated files and credentials secure, as they may contain sensitive information about your Azure resources.
